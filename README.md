# Cricket Match Prediction and Data Analysis

Welcome to the Cricket Match Prediction and Data Analysis repository! This project includes various components for cricket match predictions and data visualization. Below is an overview of the folder structure and how to use the different elements of the project.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **CNN**
- **Description**: Contains a Jupyter Notebook for binary classification to predict "Runout or Not Runout".
- **Note**: The dataset is not included due to its large size.
- **File**:
  - `binary_classification_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for binary classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### 2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
- **Description**: Includes Streamlit apps for analyzing and visualizing T20 and ODI cricket matches.
- **How to Run**: Use the following command to run the Streamlit apps:
  ```bash
  streamlit run filename.py

Files:
t20_analysis.py: Streamlit app for T20 match data analysis.
odi_analysis.py: Streamlit app for ODI match data analysis.

### 3. **Match Prediction**
Description: Features Jupyter Notebooks for predicting outcomes of ODI and T20 matches with updated accuracy metrics.
Files:
odi_prediction_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for ODI match prediction.
t20_prediction_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for T20 match prediction.

### 4. **Final Streamlit App**
Description: A comprehensive Streamlit app that combines all three datasets and predictions.
Note: The model, datasets, and label encoders are included due to their large size.
How to Run: Use the following command to launch the final Streamlit app
Streamlit run final.py
